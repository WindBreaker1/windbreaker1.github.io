This is an idea taken from Four Thousand Weeks by Oliver Burkeman, more talked about on pages 180 to 182.

Finishing projects takes many days, weeks, even years.

With that in mind, you should embrace the fact that you won't finish it in a day. You should take it as slow as possible, write 10 minutes, do 10 push-ups.

Do those extremely small things every day.

Hell, even take the weekends off.

> By rushing, your work quality will suffer, you will end up stressed and anxious, and you will be burnt out by the end.

You should stop even when you feel you have a lot of energy left. Why? Because stopping helps strengthen the muscle of patience that will permit you to return to the project again and again.

Another inspiration for this idea is the manhwa [The Lazy Lord Masters the Sword](https://myanimelist.net/manga/146827/The_Lazy_Lord_Masters_the_Sword), in which a character is training for years on end, just swinging a sword in their backyard.

In conclusion, short bouts of effort over a long period of time are better than tens of hours of effort crammed into a short period of time.
