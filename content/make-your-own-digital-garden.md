A breezy way to tag your research or learning notes is with the digital garden system.

This is a good way to return to notes and ideas you may have forgotten about to flesh them out.

An example of such a tag system would be:

- Seedling
- Sapling
- Tree

## 🌱 Seedling

The note is in the initial stage, a few sentences long.

## 🌴 Sapling

The note is in the middle stage, almost done.

## 🌳 Tree

The note is done, or as complete as it can be for now.

## ♻️ Review/Reread

Optional: you can put a review/reread tag for notes that are complete, but you may need the knowledge for later.

## Full Forest

You can use any other terminology for your notes, or even add more stages.

Good luck building your forest of knowledge!
