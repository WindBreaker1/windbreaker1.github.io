People talk about how you should spend your time 'wisely', to spend it on the 'important things in life'.

> But what does that mean, really? Who are they to decide what constitutes 'valuable' time?

## 💸 What is Valuable Time?

Is it time spend making money? Is it time spent with my family and friends? Is it time creating art?

Many would consider money to be the sole marker for a valuable existence. It is believed to be a direct correlation between value given to society and spent effort, but that could not be further from the truth.

Teachers, some of the most important people that shape the next generation of humans, are paid horrendously. Investors and CEO's, who do nothing but profit off of their companies that exploit humanity, are paid handsomely.

It is false to think that money made equals a well-lived life, or that you will be remembered just for making money.

## 📉 The Productivity Fallacy

A lot of people feel uncomfortable doing nothing. They have to feel productive, or else they feel like they wasted the day.

I think there is no such thing as a wasted day. Concepts like productivity and wasted time are man-made. You should not think of productivity as a Sword of Damocles hanging above your head. You shouldn't live with the  stress that you have to work on something constantly for your life to have value.

## 🦌 Live According to Your Nature

Don't define the value of your own time based on what the majority thinks.

Every person has their own nature. Some people are artists, some are engineers, some are MMA fighters. The most content you're going to be with your time is if you spend it according to that nature.

Studying, training, working should feel difficult, but rewarding. Essentially, you yourself should define what action makes your time valuable. 

In the end, time spent creating anything, even if it has no inherent value, is valuable in and of itself.

A picture, a sentence, a program, a song.

It is a reflection of yourself onto the world.
