In 'The Mountain is You' by Brianna Wiest, she talks about the practice of writing your flaws.

She believes that writing down your flaws will give you a to-do list on how to fix those things.

But some things, like your face, you can't really change. Even face-improving surgery is hit or miss.

It's bad to write down and constantly think about your flaws because you will think about them on a daily basis.

In my opinion, a better way to go about it is saying "I will go to the gym for an hour tomorrow" instead of "I'm fat, I need to exercise".

Both arrive at the same conclusion, but one is better for your own mental health.

Disgust, insecurity, and anger can be beneficial in feeding the willpower that will change you, but it's not a permanent solution.

In the end, as cliche as it sounds, discipline is really the best mindset to have.
