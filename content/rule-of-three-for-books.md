I recently learned a specific advice for reading books from a [reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalminimalism/s/DUIyVKDVtQ).

It says that you should have three book in a rotation:

1. One easy
2. One moderately difficult
3. One stiff

> This way, you always have one to match your interest and energy.

Examples for the three may be:

1. A fiction novel
2. A non-fiction book like an autobiography 
3. Something hard or conceptual, like a philosophy book

A final tip for effective reading is taking down notes on the most important parts of the book.
