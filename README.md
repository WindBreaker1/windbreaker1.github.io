This is my simple site.

When pushing new changes to the GitHub repo, it automatically uses `node generate.js` to update posts, and `node rss-generator.js` to create the new `rss.xml` with updated posts.

If it the Action doesn't activate automatically, do it manually in the console.

When posting a new blog post, upload your md file to the `content` folder.

Don't forget to use `serve` to test your website.
